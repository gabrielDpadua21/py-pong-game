# Python Pong Game


Pong is a classic 2D arcade game that simulates table tennis. The game features two paddles, one on each side of the screen, and a ball that bounces back and forth between them. The objective of the game is to score points by hitting the ball past the opponent's paddle.

The game is played on a rectangular field with a net in the middle. Each player controls a paddle that can be moved up and down to block the ball and send it back to the opponent. The ball moves at a constant speed and bounces off the paddles and the walls of the field.

The game ends when one player fails to block the ball and it goes past their paddle. The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.

This implementation of Pong is written in python using turtle for rendering the game graphics. The game logic is implemented using OO design pattern.
